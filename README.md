# Web Dev Exam Project

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   Run the following command in the project root directory:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all necessary dependencies as specified in package.json.

2. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

3. Open [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Additional Information

- The development server runs on port 9000. If you need to change this, modify the "dev" script in package.json.
- This project uses Tailwind CSS for styling. The configuration can be found in the project root.
- TypeScript is used for type checking. Ensure your IDE is configured to use the project's TypeScript version.
